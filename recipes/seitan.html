        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Seitan is essentially a dough made with vital wheat gluten, a high-protein wheat flour, and liquid. The dough can be rinsed or poached to become a chewy meat substitute that can be added to many different dishes. </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups vital wheat gluten</li>
            <li>1 ½ cup nutritional yeast</li>
            <li>2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>5 cups low-sodium vegetable broth, divided</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
            <li>½ small onion diced</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, crushed</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine wheat gluten, yeast, and garlic powder in large bowl. Stir in 1 cup broth and soy sauce until dough forms, adding more broth if necessary. Knead dough in bowl with spoon 3 minutes, or until elastic. Shape into 2 loaves.</li>
            <li>Place loaves in large saucepan, and add remaining 4 cups broth, onion, garlic, and enough water to cover seitan. Cover, and bring to a boil over medium heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer 30 to 45 minutes, or until seitan is firm. Remove from heat, and cool in broth.</li>
        </ol>
